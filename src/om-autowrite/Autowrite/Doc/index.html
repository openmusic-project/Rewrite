<h2> What is <b>Autowrite</b> </h2>

<p>
<b>Autowrite</b> is a project carried out at the
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/">
<em>Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique</em></a>
(<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/"><b>LaBRI</b></a>)
of the <em>Universit&eacute; Bordeaux&nbsp;I</em>, by the
<a href="http://www.labri.fr/Recherche/LLA/index-fr.htm">
LLA</a> (Logic, Formal Languages and Applications) team.
<b> Autowrite </b> is an experimental tool written in
<a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/"> CMU Common Lisp </a>
for checking properties of term rewrite systems.
It was initially designed to check call-by-need (CBN) properties of TRSs.
For this purpose, it implements the tree automata constructions used in
the decidability proofs of the call-by-need properties and many useful
operations on terms, TRSs and tree automata.
This new version of Autowrite includes new functionalities related to TRSs, timing information
but the most interesting new feature is the possibility to handle directly (load, save, combine)
bottom-up tree automata.

The graphical interface (still under construction) running under X11 
is written using
<a href="http://www.cons.org/free-clim/"> FreeCLIM </a>, the free implementation
of the 
<a href="http://clim.mikemac.com/spec/clim.html">
CLIM specification </a>. 
From this interface, one can handle TRSs, tree automata and build many tree automata related to
TRSs. one can check membership to CBN
for the different approximations of a given system.

<h2> Main features of <b>Autowrite</b> </h2>
<p>
The principal features of <b>Autowrite</b> are:
<ul>
  <li> Terms and term rewrite systems.
   Given a term t and a term rewrite system R over a signature F
  <ul>
    <li> check whether: R is left-linear, overlapping, orthogonal, constructor
    <li> check whether: R is forward-branching
    <li> compute approximations of R
    (strong-approximation, nv-approximation, linear-growing-approximation, growing-approximation) 
    <li>  decide whether R is in CBN_alpha (for the different approximations  alpha)
    and exhibits an alpha-free term in the negative case.
    <li>  Check whether NF(R) (the set of normal forms) is empty
    <li>  Check whether ENF(R) (the set of external normal forms) is empty
    <li>  If F is the signature consisting of the terms appearing in R and G be F
extended by a fresh constant symbol, decide whether the set of
terms in T(F) normalizable with (R,F), WN(R,F), is different (strictly included)
into the set of terms in T(F) normalizable with (R,F), WN(R,G,F).
The same check can be done with R extended with the rule o -> o.
    <li>  Check whether the current approximation S is arbitrary i.e. if there
exists a term t in T(F) such that t -*->(R,FU{@}) @
             
  </ul>
  <li> Tree automata. Given tree automata A and a term t <br>  
  <ul> 
    <li> decide whether t is in L(A)
    <li> decide whether L(A) is empty
    <li> compute a deterministic version of A
    <li> compute a reduced version of A
    <li> compute the complement of A
    <li> given another automaton B compute the union or the intersection of A and B
  </ul>
  <li> Automata and term rewrite systems.<br>
  <ul>
    <li> given a set of ground terms S: compute a tree automaton A_S such that L(A_S) = S
    <li> given a set of linear terms S: compute a tree automaton A_S such that L(A_S) recognizes the set of instances of S
    <li> given the set of left-handsides of a left-linear TRS R: compute an automaton
A_NF(R) such that L(A_NF(R)) = NF(R)
    <li> given tree automaton A and a left-linear growing term rewrite system: <br>
     compute an automaton C_[R,A] such that L(C_[R,A]) = (-*->)[L(A)]
    <li>  given a left-linear growing extended term rewrite system R:
 compute an automaton D_R such that L(D_R) is empty if and only if R is in CBN.
      </ul>
</ul></p>

<h2> Obtaining <b>Autowrite</b> </h2>

<p>
The <b>Autowrite</b> distribution is publically available for research purposes.
The <b>Autowrite</b> distribution consists of a Linux <tt>gzip</tt>-compressed <tt>tar</tt> file.
<br>
The currently supported machines and operating systems are listed below.
<menu>
<li> PC x86 under Linux <a href="Autowrite.tgz"><b>Autowrite.tgz</b></a>
 </menu>
Other architectures can be made available upon request.
</p>
<p>
A collection of examples of term rewrite systems to use with 
<b>Autowrite</b> is included in the Data directory of the distribution.
</p>
<h2> Installing <b>Autowrite</b> </h2>
<p>
Download the relevant Autowrite.tgz tar file <br>
<UL>
<li> tar xzvf Autowrite.tgz <br>
<li> cd Autowrite <br>
<li> ./INSTALL <br>
</UL>
</p>

<h2> Running <b>Autowrite</b> </h2>
<p>
<UL>
<li> xhost +
<li> ./autowrite
</UL>
At any time from the command line, the user may get <B>help</B> about
the current possibilities by clicking on the right-button.
Commands are accessible either thru the command line (using <B>completion</B>)
or from the menus items.
For instance, instead of
hitting the Quit button you may type Q <TAB>; 
instead of selecting the Load spec of the File menu, 
you may type 'Lo <TAB> Sp <TAB>'...
<br> Note that some examples may run for a <B> very long time </B> as the problem of deciding membership
to CBN_alpha (can be from exponential to triply exponential).
<br> 
Add your own specifications in the Data directory
