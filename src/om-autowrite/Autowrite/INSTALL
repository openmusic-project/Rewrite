;;; Requirements
#|
* A Common Lisp.  Known to work: SBCL 1.0.*

* If you wish to use the graphical interface: the MCCLIM

  ** McCLIM.  The "Orthodox New Year" release is needed, along with
     *** spatial-trees;

     *** at least one means of displaying graphics: CLX is
         recommended, but the OpenMCL/Cocoa bridge or the gtkairo
         backend are possibilities.

  ** Flexichain.  ASDF-INSTALLable or from common-lisp.net CVS, the
     flexichain project, flexichain module.

  Make sure ASDF knows how to find all of these projects.
